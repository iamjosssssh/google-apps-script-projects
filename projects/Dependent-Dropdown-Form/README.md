## File Overview
- `README.md` - documentation
- `app.js` - Apps Script
- `appsscript.json` - manifest

- `app.js` populates form dropdowns based on values stored in a spreadsheet.
- On submission the script validates selections and writes the response to the sheet.
- Trigger installation ensures the dropdown options stay in sync with the spreadsheet.
