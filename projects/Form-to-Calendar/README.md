# Form to Calendar

## Overview
This directory contains the Form to Calendar example.

## File Overview
- `Code.js` - Apps Script
- `README.md` - documentation
- `appsscript.json` - manifest


## How It Works
- `Code.js` parses form responses to create events on a specified calendar.
- The script extracts dates and times from the answers and sends confirmation emails.
- Trigger functions allow the form to automatically add events whenever someone submits.
