# FormSign Doc Signature

## Overview
This directory contains the FormSign Doc Signature example.

## File Overview
 - `utils.js` - Apps Script
 - `formSign.js` - Apps Script
- `1.sign.html` - HTML template
- `main.js` - Apps Script
- `README.md` - documentation
- `appsscript.json` - manifest


## How It Works
- `main.js` drives the workflow to collect a signature through a form and insert it into a Google Doc.
- `formSign.js` and `utils.js` manage template manipulation and file creation in Drive.
- The `1.sign.html` file renders the signing page presented to the user.
