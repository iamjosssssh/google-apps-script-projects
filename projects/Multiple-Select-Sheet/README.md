# Multiple Select Sheet

## Overview
A sidebar app for Google Sheets allowing users to select multiple items from a list.

## How It Works
- `app.js` injects a sidebar with a custom UI built from `sidebar.html`.
- Selected items are written back to the active sheet cells.
- The script demonstrates how to pass data between the sidebar and Apps Script.
