# Merge Docs

## Overview
This directory contains the Merge Docs example.

## File Overview
- `README.md` - documentation
- `appsscript.json` - manifest
- `main.js` - Apps Script


## How It Works
- `main.js` loops over a list of document URLs and combines them into one file.
- Progress information is written back to the spreadsheet so you know when merging is complete.
